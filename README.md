This notebook contains implementations of different forms of recommendation systems present in current real-world applications. There are mainly 3 forms of recommendation systems:

Demographic filtering - offer generalized recommendations to every user, according to popularity and/or genre. It offers the same movies to users with similar demographics,

Basic idea - Movies that are popular, critically acclaimed and well received would have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.

Content Based filtering - Suggest similar items based on a particular item - cast, director, genre, movie title, keywords etc.

Basic idea - If a person liked a particular item, he/she would like another item similar to it.

Collaborative Filtering - System matches person with similar interests and provides recommendations based on the matching. It doesn't require metadata like content-based counterparts.
